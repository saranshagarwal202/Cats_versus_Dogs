# Cats_versus_Dogs
This project shows the training of the famous Cats-versus-Dogs model from Kaggle, implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. I tried applying and configuring the model using a variety of CNNs and fully connected layers, to create a novel network, to maximise accuracy and minimise generalisation error. The final notebook uploaded here achieved a testing accuracy of 96.8%.
